------------------------

  o Some level of abstraction is given to some functions using 
    S3 methods. The interfaces "outliers.tstatistics" and 
    "outliers.regressors" can now be used regardless of whether 
    the baseline model is an ARIMA or a structural time series model.
    This has simplified some parts of the code and the prototype of 
    some functions where the argument "tsmethod" is no longer needed.

  o The functions 'IOtstat.arima', 'AOtstat.arima', 'LStstat.arima', 
    'TCtstat.arima' and 'SLStstat.arima' are not exported in the NAMESPACE. 
     A new function 'outliers.tstatistics' has been designed as a common 
     interface to those functions.

  o Debugging versions for the computation of the t-statistics has been removed.
    The versions of 'IOtstat.arima', 'AOtstat.arima', 'LStstat.arima', 
    'TCtstat.arima' and 'SLStstat.arima' that seem to be faster have been chosen.
    Recomputation of 'ARMAtoMA()' for each type of outlier is avoided.

  o A new function 'outliers' has been added. This function is useful to 
    easily create the input 'data.frame' (containing characters and integers) 
    of functions 'outliers.effects' and 'outliers.regressors.arima'. Thus, 
    these functions can be used as a common interface for functions 
    'XXeffect' and 'XXxreg', which are not necessary to be exported.

  o The functions 'IOeffect', 'AOeffect', 'LSeffect', 'TCeffect and 'SLSeffect'
    are not exported in the NAMESPACE. The function 'outliers.effects' is used 
    as a common interface to those functions.

  o outliers.regressors.arima() has been simplified and speeded-up by choosing 
    the versions of 'AOxreg', 'LSxreg', 'TCxreg' and 'SLSxreg' that seem to be 
    faster. Recomputation of 'ARMAtoMA()' for each type of outlier is avoided.
    Argument 'arimafit' is no longer needed.

  o The functions 'IOxreg', 'AOxreg', 'LSxreg', 'TCxreg' and 'SLSxreg' 
    are not exported in the NAMESPACE. The function 'outliers.regressors.arima' 
    is used as a common interface to those functions.

Version: 0.2
------------------------

  o The function 'outliers.regressors.arima' is a debugging version that uses 
    different versions to do the computations.
