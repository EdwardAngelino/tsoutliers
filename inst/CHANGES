Changes in version 0.5 2015-01-25
-----------------------------------  

  o This is submitted to CRAN as a TRANSITORY VERSION where some 
    functions related to package "stsm" are disabled.
    Package "stsm.class" has been merged into package "stsm".
    If the new version of "stsm" is submitted these warnings are obtained:
    "Warning: replacing previous import by 'stsm.class::char2numeric'
    when loading 'tsoutliers'".
    If "tsoutliers" is submitted first, it requires disabling "stsm" 
    functionalities since the current version of "stsm" on CRAN is not updated 
    with the class and methods defined in package "stsm.class".

  o Adapted function "tso" to the new output format from functions 
    "maxlik.Xd.XXX", where now information related to "xreg" is not 
    stored as a separate list element.

  o Removed option in remove.method = "linear-regression" since now 
    exogenous regressors are better handled by package "stms" 
    (despite possible difficulties computing standard errors).

  o Added warning informing that currently "maxit" > 1 is not allowed in 
    function "tso" for tsmethod="stsm".
    Before an uninformative error was returned.

  o Fixed function 'locate.outliers' for the case where the length of 
    argument 'types' is one.
    Thanks to Boriss Siliverstovs for reporting this issue.
  
  o The examples, DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files have been updated now that 
    the class and methods defined in package "stsm.class" have been 
    merged in package "stsm".

  o Non-standardised residuals are used in 'locate.outliers.oloop'. Despite 
    the standardised residuals can be used to obtain t-statistics and decide 
    on the significance of outliers, coefficient estimates of these regressors 
    do not reflect the scale of the data and hence the series was not adjusted 
    correctly for the presence of outliers in the iterations run in 
    'locate.outliers.oloop'.

  o The default arguments to fit a structural time series model has been changed 
    from 'stsm::maxlik.fd.scoring' to 'stsm::maxlik.td.optim' in order to take 
    advantage of some recent enhancements in package "stsm" when regressors are 
    included in the model.

  o Some issues have been modified in order to deal with the presence of missing observations.
    - 'locate.outliers': NA values (if any) are now ignored when obtaining 'id0resid'.
    - 'outliers.tstatistics.ArimaPars' and 'outliers.tstatistics.stsmSS':
      na.rm=TRUE is used in when 'quantile' is called;
      NAs generated by 'filter' when obtaining 'ao.xy' are now explicitly removed 
      instead of removing all possible NAs present in the original series.

  o The package has benefited from some updates in package "stsm" that deal with 
    external regressors. Now more reliable results are obtained when a "stsm" model 
    is used. See for example application to Nile time series in section 6.1 of the 
    document tsoutliers.pdf attached to the package.

  o Results from some simulation exercises are reported in Section 5 of the 
    document tsoutliers.pdf attached to the package.

  o Fixed file 'index.html' in the 'doc' directory and validated 
    at <http://validator.w3.org/> as HTML 4.01 Transitional.

Changes in version 0.4 2014-06-26
-----------------------------------

  o The function 'tsoutliers' has been renamed as 
    'tso' to avoid conflict with the function of the same name 
    in package 'forecast'. To keep resemblance in the names, 
    the function 'tsoutliers0' has been renamed as 'tso0'.

  o The function 'jarque.bera.test' has been renamed as 
    'JarqueBera.test' to avoid conflict with the function of 
    the same name in package 'tseries'.

  o function 'plot.tsoutliers': fixed "plot(cbind(x$y, x$yadj), ..."
    a typo ("x$adj" instead of "x$yadj") made the range of the y-axis 
    not cover the range of the original and adjusted series in some cases.

Changes in version 0.3 2014-05-17
-----------------------------------

  o First version available on CRAN.

  o Some level of abstraction is given to some functions using 
    S3 methods. The interfaces "outliers.tstatistics" and 
    "outliers.regressors" can now be used regardless of whether 
    the baseline model is an ARIMA or a structural time series model.
    This has simplified some parts of the code and the prototype of 
    some functions where the argument "tsmethod" is no longer needed.

  o The functions 'IOtstat.arima', 'AOtstat.arima', 'LStstat.arima', 
    'TCtstat.arima' and 'SLStstat.arima' are not exported in the NAMESPACE. 
     A new function 'outliers.tstatistics' has been designed as a common 
     interface to those functions.

  o Debugging versions for the computation of the t-statistics has been removed.
    The versions of 'IOtstat.arima', 'AOtstat.arima', 'LStstat.arima', 
    'TCtstat.arima' and 'SLStstat.arima' that seem to be faster have been chosen.
    Recomputation of 'ARMAtoMA()' for each type of outlier is avoided.

  o New function 'outliers' has been added. This function is useful to 
    easily create the input 'data.frame' (containing characters and integers) 
    of functions 'outliers.effects' and 'outliers.regressors.arima'. Thus, 
    these functions can be used as a common interface for functions 
    'XXeffect' and 'XXxreg', which are not necessary to be exported.

  o The functions 'IOeffect', 'AOeffect', 'LSeffect', 'TCeffect and 'SLSeffect'
    are not exported in the NAMESPACE. The function 'outliers.effects' is used 
    as a common interface to those functions.

  o 'outliers.regressors.arima' has been simplified and speeded-up by choosing 
    the versions of 'AOxreg', 'LSxreg', 'TCxreg' and 'SLSxreg' that seem to be 
    faster. Recomputation of 'ARMAtoMA()' for each type of outlier is avoided.
    Argument 'arimafit' is no longer needed.

  o The functions 'IOxreg', 'AOxreg', 'LSxreg', 'TCxreg' and 'SLSxreg' 
    are not exported in the NAMESPACE. The function 'outliers.regressors.arima' 
    is used as a common interface to those functions.

Version 0.2
-----------------------------------

  o The function 'outliers.regressors.arima' is a debugging version that uses 
    different versions to do the computations.
